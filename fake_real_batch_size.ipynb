              "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.</td>\n",

              "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.</td>\n",

              "0  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.  politicsNews\n",

Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.  politicsNews"

He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.</td>\n",

              "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.</td>\n",

              "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.</td>\n",

              "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.</td>\n",

              "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI’s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow’s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide’s campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller’s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Trump’s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. “Out of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,” he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow.</td>\n",

              "      <td>SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.</td>\n",

The story was even recounted in Bill Clinton s autobiography.But yesterday, Mrs. Clinton s campaign said she was not named for Sir Edmund after all. It was a sweet family story her mother shared to inspire greatness in her daughter, to great results I might add,  said Jennifer Hanley, a spokeswoman for the campaign.In May 1953, Sir Edmund and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, became the first men to reach the summit of Mount Everest. In 1995, shortly after meeting Sir Edmund, Mrs. Clinton said that her mother, Dorothy Rodham, had long told her she was named for the famous mountaineer.  It had two l s, which is how she thought she was supposed to spell Hillary,  Mrs. Clinton said at the time, after meeting Sir Edmund.  So when I was born, she called me Hillary, and she always told me it s because of Sir Edmund Hillary. Even though Bill Clinton repeated the story in his 2004 autobiography,  My Life,  Hillary Clinton did not mention it in her own autobiography,  Living History,  which was published in 2003.But one big hole has been poked in the story over the years, both in cyberspace and elsewhere: Sir Edmund became famous only after climbing Everest in 1953. Mrs. Clinton, as it happens, was born in 1947. Via: NYT\n",

EU leaders are almost certain to judge on Friday that  sufficient progress  has been made on the rights of citizens, the Brexit divorce bill and the Irish border to allow negotiations to move to the next phase. The EU executive recommended last week that leaders approve the start of trade talks.\n",

And now he s back to poke Trump in the eye by mocking the president-elect s attack on actress Meryl Streep.Most people know of Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker in Star Wars but he s also a very talented voice-over actor. His voice as The Joker is amazing and using his skills to mock Trump is an effective tool. His newest jab at Trump has gone viral on Twitter and it s about the best thing you ll hear all day. Am I the ONLY one man enough to confront this #OverratedFlunkyLoser without resorting to an ad hominem assault?

She is a .. Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never  mocked  a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him .,  he continued.He added,  groveling  when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media!The incoming president lashes out at people who hurt his feelings. People like Meryl Streep, for example. He s about to hold the highest seat in the land, yet he shows no restraint on Twitter where he has nearly 20 million followers, some of which probably follow him just to see what outrageous thing he will tweet out next. He tweets about nukes, he manipulates the stock market by attacking brands, showing that he s already abusing the power of the presidency even before he takes the oath of office. When he takes over the @POTUS account, we suggest you report his tweets for impersonating a president. Impersonation accounts are against Twitter s terms of use.Photo via Wiki\n",
              "24740    The whiner-in-chief struck again with yet another early morning Twitter tantrum.Donald Trump can t handle the fact that he lost the popular vote, especially to a woman.Hillary Clinton s margin of victory in nearly 3 million votes, but Trump stole the election with the help of Russian hackers. Even his electoral vote win is one of the smallest in the last 100 years.But even after the Electoral College wrongly certified him to be president, Trump is STILL complaining about losing the popular vote and is making excuses to explain the loss rather than moving on and focusing on the huge job he s about to take over in January.Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2016I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote   but would campaign differently  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2016Trump is even bitching about not being praised by the media for not spending as much money to win. Of course, why spend money on advertising when you can promise favors for Putin in exchange for help spreading propaganda on the Internet?I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2016Apparently, we re going to be hearing Trump whine about the popular vote for the next four years because his ego can t handle losing.And Twitter users were quick to put Trump in his place.@realDonaldTrump remember when you said the electoral college was bad  Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) December 21, 2016@realDonaldTrump Losing the popular vote is eating you up like that worm Khan dropped in Chekov s ear.  pourmecoffee (@pourmecoffee) December 21, 2016.@realDonaldTrump Also: pic.twitter.com/98rH2ODahZ  Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 21, 2016@realDonaldTrump Really?

Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) December 21, 2016@realDonaldTrump yes Donald, you won. Continue to gloat. We all know your win is unpresidented. Why not spend time doing something for USA?  ? (@VeeVee) December 21, 2016@realDonaldTrump This really gets to you, doesn t it? You re a fucking child. Your ego is ruining the country and it s still not enough.  Jon Bershad (@JonBershad) December 21, 2016@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/Dz675z5dPn  marisa kabas (@MarisaKabas) December 21, 2016For weeks, Trump has been bitching about how people should move on after the election, but he can t even do that himself. Now Saturday Night Live will have even more material to mock him with when the show returns. For now, we ll have to settle for the roasting Twitter just delivered.Featured image via Steve Pope/Getty Images\n",

He s no longer associated with Miss Universe, but surely that prepared him for foreign policy and running a country, just as his golf courses in Scotland did. President Obama s labor secretary, Tom Perez, took Trump to the cleaners over this during an interview on Meet the Press, because Perez knows that Trump doesn t know foreign policy at all.Host Chuck Todd asked Perez how he would describe his own foreign policy, and Perez replied with a smirk and razor-sharp sarcasm: Well, I haven t run a Ms. Universe pageant, and I don t own any golf courses in Scotland, Chuck, so I don t have what Donald Trump has, and I m very sorry about that. That hits King Dunce right where it hurts, because King Dunce doesn t know how to take advice, let alone actually learn anything. Remember, King Dunce the man who gave us this little nugget of disease-ridden feces: I m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I ve said a lot of things I know what I m doing and I listen to a lot of people, I talk to a lot of people and at the appropriate time I ll tell you who the people are. But my primary consultant is myself and I have a good instinct for this stuff. He has a touch of instinct for business, and that s it. He thinks government, and particularly foreign affairs, are just like business and he can treat them with strong-arm tactics and threats of lawsuits   oh wait, war  if they don t give in.King Trump s foreign policy sounds great to ignorant voters who can t think for themselves. It s all about  America first.  It s a lot of the same mentality that led to Brexit, and it s true that world s uppermost caste has left working class people in the dust in the pursuit of their own black and vile greed. However, Trump wants to bully and muscle other countries into doing what he wants. He doesn t want actual negotiations.It wouldn t be surprising to discover that His Royal Narcissist thinks that his  me first  mentality is the same as having an  America first  mentality. His confidence in his own greatness is part of why he talks about all his businesses, including his golf courses, as though they ve given him all the experience he needs to run one of the most powerful countries in the world.As Perez explained, Trump the Dump is all about himself and his own profits and glory rather than America first, because otherwise, he wouldn t fight labor unions and he wouldn t have his clothing and campaign gear made in the very foreign countries he demonizes regularly on the campaign trail.Perez nailed him to the wall on this.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n",

Their Russia problems are mounting by the hour, and they refuse to acknowledge that there are problems surrounding all of this. To them, it s  fake news,  or a  hoax.  However, the facts bear things out differently, and it seems that there are now cracks in the Congressional public leadership.Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, is fed up. He is now demanding that Donald Trump, Jr. and former 2016 Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort testify before his committee regarding the now infamous shady meeting between Donald Trump and the shady Russian lawyer who promised dirt on 2016 Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. In fact, this information is due, well, NOW. This demand sends a few signals to team Trump   most notably that they should not fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller under any circumstances, despite the fact that it seems that this seems to be what Trump s White House is laying the groundwork, so to speak, to do as we speak.Here is the tweet regarding Grassley s warning:Also, anyone who thinks that Senator Grassley and the rest of the Senate are not serious about this only needs to look at the warning that has already been given: Trump Jr. and Manafort will either follow orders, or be served with subpoenas that force them to comply. If they refuse, they will be held in contempt of Congress, which carries with it serious jail time.Even the cruel, craven creatures within the GOP are sick of Donald Trump s corruption and his scandal-ridden White House. They are angry that he staged a hostile takeover of their party, first with birtherism and giving them a permanently racist label all while decimating all efforts that were made to pretend the Republican Party isn t a hotbed of racism, and while turning their worlds upside down, and with it, the nation. It seems that old-timers like Grassley, who are clearly sick of Trump s bullshit, just might be the ones who could save the republic. All they need is a bit of courage.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images</td>\n",

After all, how can we forget all the missteps, gaffes, weirdness, and sheer idiocies of such candidates as Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina?There s a video making the rounds on Twitter that does just that, and eulogizes three of these failed candidates as though they re dead (and the GOP itself might as well be dead at this point anyway). Appropriately titled,  A Eulogy for the GOP,  people make short speeches about each of these candidates.Once past the man who actually says Jeb Bush was qualified to be president, there are fake tears, with journalist and comedienne Francesca Fiorentini saying: Dearly beloved, we re gathered here today to commemorate the candidates that are no longer with us. One man, speaking to an amusing, circus-y rendition of Chopin s Funeral March, remembers Jeb this way: Jeb, we hardly knew ye. It s too bad that your policies couldn t find their way out of the Republican morass. Indeed, it was like Jeb and his policies were invisible sometimes, although many felt that he would win the nomination early on. His best performances often came during debates, when he d get into out-and-out fights with Donald Trump over virtually everything under the sun. He also had a bad habit of defending his brother s actions in Iraq, memorably saying,  As it relates to my brother, there s one thing I know for sure: He kept us safe. Moving on to Marco Rubio, Fiorentini herself says: He was called so many things:  Young, charming, Lil  Marco.' That last nickname is, of course, a reference to Trump s penchant for name-calling. Then, a man speaking Spanish remembers Rubio this way: Marco, why aren t you a normal boy? Another said that his involvement in the Gang of Eight immigration bill killed him as a candidate, to which Fiorentini replies: Some people die of gang violence. He died of Gang of Eight violence. The makers of this video saved the absolute best for last, of course, which is Ben Carson. On our dear Dr. Carson, one of the speakers says: He would gently rock me to sleep with his monotone voice. Carson was especially well known for seemingly being asleep half the time. If we saw his eyes open wide, it was surprising, and likely because he was surprised himself. His voice is soft, his speech is slow, and it really can be hard to stay awake while he s talking. Imagine him giving a State of the Union address!To see the whole video, especially the spectacular ending after Carson s eulogy, watch below:Take a moment to say your g byes to these GOP candidates. ? https://t.co/6O70bl9zV8  AJ+ (@ajplus) May 7, 2016 Featured image via screen capture from embedded video</td>\n",

Their Russia problems are mounting by the hour, and they refuse to acknowledge that there are problems surrounding all of this. To them, it s  fake news,  or a  hoax.  However, the facts bear things out differently, and it seems that there are now cracks in the Congressional public leadership.Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, is fed up. He is now demanding that Donald Trump, Jr. and former 2016 Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort testify before his committee regarding the now infamous shady meeting between Donald Trump and the shady Russian lawyer who promised dirt on 2016 Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. In fact, this information is due, well, NOW. This demand sends a few signals to team Trump   most notably that they should not fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller under any circumstances, despite the fact that it seems that this seems to be what Trump s White House is laying the groundwork, so to speak, to do as we speak.Here is the tweet regarding Grassley s warning:Also, anyone who thinks that Senator Grassley and the rest of the Senate are not serious about this only needs to look at the warning that has already been given: Trump Jr. and Manafort will either follow orders, or be served with subpoenas that force them to comply. If they refuse, they will be held in contempt of Congress, which carries with it serious jail time.Even the cruel, craven creatures within the GOP are sick of Donald Trump s corruption and his scandal-ridden White House. They are angry that he staged a hostile takeover of their party, first with birtherism and giving them a permanently racist label all while decimating all efforts that were made to pretend the Republican Party isn t a hotbed of racism, and while turning their worlds upside down, and with it, the nation. It seems that old-timers like Grassley, who are clearly sick of Trump s bullshit, just might be the ones who could save the republic. All they need is a bit of courage.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images  ...   0.0\n",
              "27917  Now that Donald Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee, it s time to remember all those other candidates who tried so hard to beat him in the race to the White House. After all, how can we forget all the missteps, gaffes, weirdness, and sheer idiocies of such candidates as Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina?There s a video making the rounds on Twitter that does just that, and eulogizes three of these failed candidates as though they re dead (and the GOP itself might as well be dead at this point anyway). Appropriately titled,  A Eulogy for the GOP,  people make short speeches about each of these candidates.Once past the man who actually says Jeb Bush was qualified to be president, there are fake tears, with journalist and comedienne Francesca Fiorentini saying: Dearly beloved, we re gathered here today to commemorate the candidates that are no longer with us. One man, speaking to an amusing, circus-y rendition of Chopin s Funeral March, remembers Jeb this way: Jeb, we hardly knew ye. It s too bad that your policies couldn t find their way out of the Republican morass. Indeed, it was like Jeb and his policies were invisible sometimes, although many felt that he would win the nomination early on. His best performances often came during debates, when he d get into out-and-out fights with Donald Trump over virtually everything under the sun. He also had a bad habit of defending his brother s actions in Iraq, memorably saying,  As it relates to my brother, there s one thing I know for sure: He kept us safe. Moving on to Marco Rubio, Fiorentini herself says: He was called so many things:  Young, charming, Lil  Marco.' That last nickname is, of course, a reference to Trump s penchant for name-calling. Then, a man speaking Spanish remembers Rubio this way: Marco, why aren t you a normal boy? Another said that his involvement in the Gang of Eight immigration bill killed him as a candidate, to which Fiorentini replies: Some people die of gang violence. He died of Gang of Eight violence. The makers of this video saved the absolute best for last, of course, which is Ben Carson. On our dear Dr. Carson, one of the speakers says: He would gently rock me to sleep with his monotone voice. Carson was especially well known for seemingly being asleep half the time. If we saw his eyes open wide, it was surprising, and likely because he was surprised himself. His voice is soft, his speech is slow, and it really can be hard to stay awake while he s talking. Imagine him giving a State of the Union address!To see the whole video, especially the spectacular ending after Carson s eulogy, watch below:Take a moment to say your g byes to these GOP candidates. ? https://t.co/6O70bl9zV8  AJ+ (@ajplus) May 7, 2016 Featured image via screen capture from embedded video  ...   0.0\n",

              "      <td>BEIJING/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As U.S. President Donald Trump and some of America s democratic allies talk up a vision of  Indo-Pacific  cooperation, China is determined to ensure that the future belongs to  Asia .   The increasing use of the phrase  Indo-Pacific  by Trump and his team during their marathon Asian jaunt this week, instead of the  Asia-Pacific  term that has long been common in business and diplomacy, is being greeted with thinly-veiled sneers in Beijing.  Trump choosing to use the term and actually making it happen are two totally different things,  Diao Daming, an American studies expert at Renmin University in Beijing, told a forum on Friday.    The region is leading global development and Trump wants America to be first, so he could not ignore its existence. He had to say something to the region, so we have  Indo-Pacific . But as yet it s just a concept and we don t know what it means.  Beyond the wordplay lies both concern and scepticism in Beijing at U.S. attempts to complicate China s strategic domain, particularly by encouraging rival power India to work more closely militarily with Japan. Tokyo recently backed New Delhi during India s border stand-off with China.    Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not dignify  Indo-Pacific  by name in a statement this week, but noted that  this concept has been mentioned many times .    We hope that the Asia-Pacific region can become a stable, prosperous and orderly region....where we are capable of managing differences and have the wisdom to resolve the disputes,  she said.    Indo-Pacific  has grown in usage across diplomatic and security circles in Australia, India and Japan in recent years, shorthand for a broader and democratic-led region in place of the  Asia-Pacific , which to some places an authoritarian China too firmly at the center.   Trump and his team have given it fresh currency in recent days, starting in Seoul and Tokyo, building on the rhetoric of his secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who last month talked of the need to support a  free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific .   Describing the Indian and Pacific Oceans as a  single strategic arena , Tillerson went further as he described India and the United States as  bookends  within that region.    In concrete terms, it will lead to great co-ordination between the Indian, Japanese and American militaries including maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, amphibious warfare, and humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and search and rescue,  he said.   Not all allies are convinced, however.   When Trump s White House issued a statement after the U.S.-South Korea summit on Wednesday describing the alliance as a  linchpin for stability, security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific , South Korea s presidential Blue House issued a note of caution.   While the phrase  Indo-Pacific  matched some of South Korea s policies aimed at diversification,  we felt there was more discussion necessary to see whether it is an appropriate term to be used in our efforts toward...joint strategic goals , the Blue House statement said.   Welcoming the trend is Indian navy Captain Gurpreet Khurana, who was among the first to coin the Indo-Pacific concept in an academic paper back in 2007.   The rise of India as an economic power following its free market reforms and then its gradual military build-up was itself a key factor in the increasing significance of the Indian Ocean, he said.    India could no longer be excluded from any over-arching reckoning in the Asia-Pacific, be it economic or security related,  said Khurana, of the military-funded National Maritime Foundation. Chinese officials and experts have long bristled at any perceived attempt to contain a rising China.  But Trump s Indo-Pacific policy should not be underestimated by China, because India, Japan and Australia are united by being on the wrong side of China s development strategy for the region, according to Jia Wenshan, an expert on China s foreign policy at the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization.  China needs to as soon as possible deal with the Indo-Pacific alliance, as it is absolutely in conflict with Belt and Road,  Jia said, referring to the Chinese president s signature initiative to re-establish trade and infrastructure ties between China and nations throughout Central and Southeast Asia.  Behind Indo-Pacific you have Japan s economic support, India s development speed and Australia s fears of China, these are all strategic realities.</td>\n",

              "      <td>UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States has proposed that the United Nations Security Council blacklist 10 ships for transporting banned items from North Korea, according to documents seen by Reuters on Tuesday. The vessels are accused of  conducting illegal ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels or illegally transporting North Korean coal to other countries for exports,  the United States said in its proposal. If none of the 15 members of the Security Council s North Korea sanctions committee object to the ships being designated by Thursday afternoon, the U.S. proposal will be approved.  Countries are required to ban blacklisted ships from entering their ports. Four ships were designated for carrying coal from North Korea by the council s North Korea sanctions committee in October. North Korea is under a U.N. arms embargo and the Security Council has banned trade in exports such as coal, textiles, seafood, iron and other minerals to choke funding for Pyongyang s missile and nuclear programs.  In September, the council put a cap of 2 million barrels a year on refined petroleum products exports to North Korea. The ships proposed to be blacklisted are: Xin Sheng Hai (flag unknown); Hong-Kong-flagged Lighthouse Winmore; Togo-flagged Yu Yuan; Panama-flagged Glory Hope 1 (also known as Orient Shenyu), Kai Xiang, and Billions No. 18; and North Korean-flagged Ul Ji Bong 6, Rung Ra 2, Rye Song Gang 1, and Sam Jong 2. Reclusive North Korea has boasted of developing a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and reaching the mainland United States in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and international condemnation. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday urged North Korea to carry out a  sustained cessation  of weapons testing to allow the two countries to hold talks. He did not specify how long the lull should last. North Korea conducted missile tests at a steady pace since April, then paused in September after firing a rocket that passed over Japan s Hokkaido island. But it renewed tests in November when it fired a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, which flew higher and further than previous tests.</td>\n",

              "      <td>OSLO (Reuters) - The International Campaign for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons issued the following statement after winning the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday:  It is a great honor to have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2017 in recognition of our role in achieving the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.   This historic agreement, adopted on 7 July with the backing of 122 nations, offers a powerful, much-needed alternative to a world in which threats of mass destruction are allowed to prevail and, indeed, are escalating.  The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) is a coalition of non-governmental organizations in one hundred countries.   By harnessing the power of the people, we have worked to bring an end to the most destructive weapon ever created   the only weapon that poses an existential threat to all humanity.  This prize is a tribute to the tireless efforts of many millions of campaigners and concerned citizens worldwide who, ever since the dawn of the atomic age, have loudly protested nuclear weapons, insisting that they can serve no legitimate purpose and must be forever banished from the face of our earth.  It is a tribute also to the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki   the hibakusha   and victims of nuclear test explosions around the world, whose searing testimonies and unstinting advocacy were instrumental in securing this landmark agreement.  The treaty categorically outlaws the worst weapons of mass destruction and establishes a clear pathway to their total elimination. It is a response to the ever-deepening concern of the international community that any use of nuclear weapons would inflict catastrophic, widespread and long-lasting harm on people and our living planet.  We are proud to have played a major role its creation, including through advocacy and participation in diplomatic conferences, and we will work assiduously in coming years to ensure its full implementation. Any nation that seeks a more peaceful world, free from the nuclear menace, will sign and ratify this crucial accord without delay.  The belief of some governments that nuclear weapons are a legitimate and essential source of security is not only misguided, but also dangerous, for it incites proliferation and undermines disarmament. All nations should reject these weapons completely   before they are ever used again.  This is a time of great global tension, when fiery rhetoric could all too easily lead us, inexorably, to unspeakable horror. The specter of nuclear conflict looms large once more. If ever there were a moment for nations to declare their unequivocal opposition to nuclear weapons, that moment is now.  We applaud those nations that have already signed and ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, and we urge all others to follow their lead. It offers a pathway forward at a time of alarming crisis. Disarmament is not a pipe dream, but an urgent humanitarian necessity.  We most humbly thank the Norwegian Nobel Committee. This award shines a needed light on the path the ban treaty provides towards a world free of nuclear weapons. Before it is too late, we must take that path.</td>\n",

              "0  BEIJING/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As U.S. President Donald Trump and some of America s democratic allies talk up a vision of  Indo-Pacific  cooperation, China is determined to ensure that the future belongs to  Asia .   The increasing use of the phrase  Indo-Pacific  by Trump and his team during their marathon Asian jaunt this week, instead of the  Asia-Pacific  term that has long been common in business and diplomacy, is being greeted with thinly-veiled sneers in Beijing.  Trump choosing to use the term and actually making it happen are two totally different things,  Diao Daming, an American studies expert at Renmin University in Beijing, told a forum on Friday.    The region is leading global development and Trump wants America to be first, so he could not ignore its existence. He had to say something to the region, so we have  Indo-Pacific . But as yet it s just a concept and we don t know what it means.  Beyond the wordplay lies both concern and scepticism in Beijing at U.S. attempts to complicate China s strategic domain, particularly by encouraging rival power India to work more closely militarily with Japan. Tokyo recently backed New Delhi during India s border stand-off with China.    Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not dignify  Indo-Pacific  by name in a statement this week, but noted that  this concept has been mentioned many times .    We hope that the Asia-Pacific region can become a stable, prosperous and orderly region....where we are capable of managing differences and have the wisdom to resolve the disputes,  she said.    Indo-Pacific  has grown in usage across diplomatic and security circles in Australia, India and Japan in recent years, shorthand for a broader and democratic-led region in place of the  Asia-Pacific , which to some places an authoritarian China too firmly at the center.   Trump and his team have given it fresh currency in recent days, starting in Seoul and Tokyo, building on the rhetoric of his secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who last month talked of the need to support a  free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific .   Describing the Indian and Pacific Oceans as a  single strategic arena , Tillerson went further as he described India and the United States as  bookends  within that region.    In concrete terms, it will lead to great co-ordination between the Indian, Japanese and American militaries including maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, amphibious warfare, and humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and search and rescue,  he said.   Not all allies are convinced, however.   When Trump s White House issued a statement after the U.S.-South Korea summit on Wednesday describing the alliance as a  linchpin for stability, security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific , South Korea s presidential Blue House issued a note of caution.   While the phrase  Indo-Pacific  matched some of South Korea s policies aimed at diversification,  we felt there was more discussion necessary to see whether it is an appropriate term to be used in our efforts toward...joint strategic goals , the Blue House statement said.   Welcoming the trend is Indian navy Captain Gurpreet Khurana, who was among the first to coin the Indo-Pacific concept in an academic paper back in 2007.   The rise of India as an economic power following its free market reforms and then its gradual military build-up was itself a key factor in the increasing significance of the Indian Ocean, he said.    India could no longer be excluded from any over-arching reckoning in the Asia-Pacific, be it economic or security related,  said Khurana, of the military-funded National Maritime Foundation. Chinese officials and experts have long bristled at any perceived attempt to contain a rising China.  But Trump s Indo-Pacific policy should not be underestimated by China, because India, Japan and Australia are united by being on the wrong side of China s development strategy for the region, according to Jia Wenshan, an expert on China s foreign policy at the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization.  China needs to as soon as possible deal with the Indo-Pacific alliance, as it is absolutely in conflict with Belt and Road,  Jia said, referring to the Chinese president s signature initiative to re-establish trade and infrastructure ties between China and nations throughout Central and Southeast Asia.  Behind Indo-Pacific you have Japan s economic support, India s development speed and Australia s fears of China, these are all strategic realities.  ...   0.0\n",

The vessels are accused of  conducting illegal ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels or illegally transporting North Korean coal to other countries for exports,  the United States said in its proposal. If none of the 15 members of the Security Council s North Korea sanctions committee object to the ships being designated by Thursday afternoon, the U.S. proposal will be approved.  Countries are required to ban blacklisted ships from entering their ports. Four ships were designated for carrying coal from North Korea by the council s North Korea sanctions committee in October. North Korea is under a U.N. arms embargo and the Security Council has banned trade in exports such as coal, textiles, seafood, iron and other minerals to choke funding for Pyongyang s missile and nuclear programs.  In September, the council put a cap of 2 million barrels a year on refined petroleum products exports to North Korea. The ships proposed to be blacklisted are: Xin Sheng Hai (flag unknown); Hong-Kong-flagged Lighthouse Winmore; Togo-flagged Yu Yuan; Panama-flagged Glory Hope 1 (also known as Orient Shenyu), Kai Xiang, and Billions No. 18; and North Korean-flagged Ul Ji Bong 6, Rung Ra 2, Rye Song Gang 1, and Sam Jong 2. Reclusive North Korea has boasted of developing a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and reaching the mainland United States in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and international condemnation. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday urged North Korea to carry out a  sustained cessation  of weapons testing to allow the two countries to hold talks. He did not specify how long the lull should last. North Korea conducted missile tests at a steady pace since April, then paused in September after firing a rocket that passed over Japan s Hokkaido island. But it renewed tests in November when it fired a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, which flew higher and further than previous tests.  ...   0.0\n",

This historic agreement, adopted on 7 July with the backing of 122 nations, offers a powerful, much-needed alternative to a world in which threats of mass destruction are allowed to prevail and, indeed, are escalating.  The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) is a coalition of non-governmental organizations in one hundred countries.   By harnessing the power of the people, we have worked to bring an end to the most destructive weapon ever created   the only weapon that poses an existential threat to all humanity.  This prize is a tribute to the tireless efforts of many millions of campaigners and concerned citizens worldwide who, ever since the dawn of the atomic age, have loudly protested nuclear weapons, insisting that they can serve no legitimate purpose and must be forever banished from the face of our earth.  It is a tribute also to the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki   the hibakusha   and victims of nuclear test explosions around the world, whose searing testimonies and unstinting advocacy were instrumental in securing this landmark agreement.  The treaty categorically outlaws the worst weapons of mass destruction and establishes a clear pathway to their total elimination. It is a response to the ever-deepening concern of the international community that any use of nuclear weapons would inflict catastrophic, widespread and long-lasting harm on people and our living planet.  We are proud to have played a major role its creation, including through advocacy and participation in diplomatic conferences, and we will work assiduously in coming years to ensure its full implementation. Any nation that seeks a more peaceful world, free from the nuclear menace, will sign and ratify this crucial accord without delay.  The belief of some governments that nuclear weapons are a legitimate and essential source of security is not only misguided, but also dangerous, for it incites proliferation and undermines disarmament. All nations should reject these weapons completely   before they are ever used again.  This is a time of great global tension, when fiery rhetoric could all too easily lead us, inexorably, to unspeakable horror. The specter of nuclear conflict looms large once more. If ever there were a moment for nations to declare their unequivocal opposition to nuclear weapons, that moment is now.  We applaud those nations that have already signed and ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, and we urge all others to follow their lead. It offers a pathway forward at a time of alarming crisis. Disarmament is not a pipe dream, but an urgent humanitarian necessity.  We most humbly thank the Norwegian Nobel Committee. This award shines a needed light on the path the ban treaty provides towards a world free of nuclear weapons. Before it is too late, we must take that path.  ...   0.0\n",

              "      <td>Follow the money on this one Mexico is spending over $1.6 billion dollars on flat screens for millions at a cost of $145.00 instead of just $40.00 for a decoder box. I m sure if you dig deep enough you ll find some sort of Carlos Slim corruption. He s the Mexican billionaire who made tons of money on the  Obamaphone  he provided for America. Nice, huh? We ll be checking into this one just to see if there s any connection to American corruption. It just doesn t pass the smell test MEXICO CITY   Cradling a flat-screen television set in her arms, Tomasa Lopez beamed at her good fortune: She d just taken part in the world s biggest distribution of free digital televisions.Lopez, a domestic servant, was among thousands of people who ve thronged a cavernous tent in the populous working-class Iztapalapa district, one of hundreds of venues across Mexico where the poor are receiving some of the 10 million digital television sets the government is giving away at no charge.It s a program costing the Mexican treasury $1.6 billion in a push to convert the nation from analog television signals to a digital format. The United States made the switch in 2009. I am happy,  Lopez said.  We ve always wanted a digital television. We ll see more channels. The kids will see cartoons. Other nations, such as Argentina, have given away digital television sets, but none on the scale of Mexico, and the program has proved controversial. Critics question why the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto is giving away 24-inch flat-screen televisions, each costing around $145, when decoder boxes that allow older analog televisions to remain in use   the U.S. solution   cost only about $40.It s not just the recipients of TVs who benefit. Television manufacturers clustered along Mexico s northern border also profit, as do the two powerful media conglomerates that are moving quickly into digital services. The two companies will soon face competition from a third television network mandated into existence in 2013 with a constitutional reform to bring greater competition to the industry.At the entrance to the delivery tent, a recipient of a television set, Jose Luis Rodriguez, reproached a government official for suggesting the sets were free. Stop using that word. It s paid for with our taxes. It s not free,  sputtered Rodriguez, who works for the federal social security institute.Already, the government has given away 4.6 million televisions in a massive operation that requires fleets of trucks to deliver the sets, and masses of workers to check documents, take fingerprints and scan the bar codes of the sets to ensure that each family gets only one.Recipients are all low-income Mexicans who take part in one of several government social service programs, including Prospera, which is the national crusade against hunger, and Liconsa, a subsidized milk program.A sense of urgency pervades the program. The constitutional reform enacted in 2013 gives the government a deadline of Dec. 31 to convert the nation to digital television. In recent weeks, government teams have been handing out 30,000 to 40,000 sets a day, but will have to double that figure to meet the deadline.Administrators for the program say it will have many benefits, among them raising the number of people with access to the Internet and cutting electricity usage. An analog television consumes 320 to 340 watts, and if you add a decoder then it s another nine watts,  said Javier Lizarraga Galindo, an adviser behind the program at the Communications and Transport Secretariat.  An energy efficient digital TV like the ones we are giving out in Mexico consumes less than 40 watts. Gabriel Sosa Plata, a professor at the Autonomous Metropolitan University and frequent commentator on television issues, said he thinks energy consumption might actually go up. Although analog signals are supposed to end on Dec. 31, he thinks many people will buy decoder boxes and move the old sets into their children s rooms. Instead of having just one television, they will have two, and that means more electricity consumption,  Sosa Plata said.Skeptics also question whether the TVs really will make the Internet more accessible. The digital TVs offered by the state have USB and HDMI ports, but hooking them to the Internet would require additional hardware and, for now, a contract with a provider, though the government has pledged eventually to offer free wireless service.Mexico already provides free Wi-Fi at or near public parks, squares and government buildings in most of the nation s 2,400 municipalities and under the telecom reform is required to expand it to as many as 250,000 sites by 2018. Still only about 50 percent of Mexico s 120 million citizens regularly access the Internet.Criticism of the program also has centered on the bidding for the purchase of the television sets. Mexico is the world s largest assembler of TVs, producing between 35 and 40 million a year. Seven different companies with plants in Mexico, mostly along the U.S. border, have taken part in supplying the program. The first stage was not as transparent as it should have been. We were all suspicious,  said Jorge Negrete Pacheco, executive director of Mediatelecom, a consultancy in Mexico City on telecommunications regulation.  It was inevitable to think like this because none of the winners (of bids) were known brands. Negrete said the South Korean manufacturer Samsung was disqualified  for offering a better product  than required under the bid conditions. The winner of one bid sold televisions sets under the brand Diamante, largely unknown.The two television networks, Televisa and TV Azteca, are installing digital transmitters around the country. TV Azteca broadcasts on 180 channels while Televisa operates 220 channels. The two companies capture a majority of all advertising spent in the country for all media.By next year, however, a third network will step into the fray. Grupo Imagen Media, owner of Cadenatres, will begin broadcasting, after winning a bid in March to occupy 123 channels spread across the country:HERE S WHAT WE FOUND ON THIS   CARLOS SLIM CONNECTION: Mexican media company Grupo Imagen, which has just won one of two new national TV concessions, may look to move into the lucrative telecoms sector, the chief executive of the family-owned company said on Thursday.Grupo Imagen was awarded the free-to-air TV concession on Wednesday after bidding 1.81 billion pesos ($116.8 million). The auction was part of a government overhaul of the hidebound phone and TV markets, which are controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim s America Movil and broadcaster Televisa.Grupo Imagen, the media arm of privately held banking, hotel, construction and hospital company Grupo Empresarial Angeles (GEA), is run by Olegario Vazquez Aldir, an up-and-coming Mexican mogul.In an interview, Vazquez Aldir acknowledged the threat posed to free-to-air TV by new technologies including Netflix, and said the company might at some point follow in the footsteps of Televisa, by looking to move into the more lucrative telecoms market. I don t rule out that in the future, we could strike alliances with telecoms companies,  he said.  We understand perfectly well the challenges posed by new technologies, and that the younger generations are consuming content through other digital platforms. Vazquez Aldir said he had not spoken with Slim or any other telecom companies. Slim s America Movil is trying to offload assets to comply with new regulation resulting from the government s telecom reform, which was finalized last year.Grupo Imagen expects to invest 10 billion pesos in the new network over the next 36 months, Vazquez Aldir said. It aims to be broadcasting in Mexico s main cities by January 2016 and to have the rest of the country covered within three years.The money would mainly be spent on buying or renting land to install broadcast infrastructure, he said, adding that the company hoped to sell its content eventually in the United States, to capitalize on the growing Latino market thereNegrete said the advent of a third channel  is a democratic message because it will offer a new source of information, different newscasts. This seems very positive. Read more: ocregister</td>\n",

              "      <td>The draft version of the Democratic Party platform released on Friday evening contains a provision pushing for an end to the death penalty in America. It is something the party has never done before, even though it has fielded candidates opposed to the criminal punishment.Progressives are rightly pointing it out as a considerable move in the right direction.The latest draft of the party s platform, released Friday, says the death penalty  has proven to be a cruel and unusual form of punishment  that  has no place in the United States of America. The inclusion of the provision represents a victory of sorts for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders   a longtime opponent of the punishment who has said he is remaining in the presidential race in order to fight for progressive causes.Sanders offered mild praise for the platform Friday evening, tweeting,  The Democratic Platform includes some accomplishments that will begin to move this country in the right direction. The party platform is not binding, and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton has not completely come out against the penalty. During the primary debates, Clinton said she believed it had  very limited use  in the case of the most extreme crimes, like terrorist attacks similar to 9/11.The inclusion of anti-death penalty language continues the forward momentum seen over the last few years in which several states have banned the practice.The United States is only one of 36 countries in the world that still has capital punishment. It is banned in 103 countries, and in another 50 countries it has not been used for 10 years while still remaining on the books.Executions have been trending downwards in America over the last few years. In 2009, 52 people were executed, dropping to 35 in 2014 and 28 in 2015. So far in 2016, 14 people have been executed in the United States with the most recent being Earl Forrest on May 11, 2016 in Missouri. Forrest killed two people in a drug dispute, then killed a sheriff s deputy in an ensuing shootout.Featured image via Flickr</td>\n",

              "      <td>Republican presidential candidates were asked if they owned a gun. Here s how they stacked up:A profile on each the remaining GOP candidates, including their NRA rating can be found here:Donald Trump owns a handgun. Here he is pictured receiving a ceremonial rifle at a military academy Photo: Getty Images Donald Trump appears to be part of a rare breed: a New Yorker with a handgun.New York City has some of the most stringent gun laws in the country and applicants for a gun license go through a lengthy process and must be interviewed in person by police.But a 2010 list of gun owners in the city showed Mr Trump had a carry business license, which allows him to carry a concealed handgun on his person. To get a carry business license you must prove you have a valid reason to carry a gun related to work   for example if you work with cash and might be targeted for robbery. It is unclear what reason Mr Trump gave in order to obtain his license but he could argue his public profile makes him a potential target.The billionaire was cagey during an interview with NBC earlier this year, saying he still had a gun and a license but it was  none of your business  if he ever used it. A spokeswoman declined to give details.Mr Trump has flitted between being a Democrat, Republican and independent in recent years and his positions on gun control have shifted also.In 2000, he wrote that he backed Bill Clinton s ban on assault weapons and supported  a slightly longer  waiting period for buying a gun. He appears to have recanted and no longer supports any new gun controls. The problem is once you get into that you start getting into a situation, the slippery slope, where all of a sudden you are going to really violate the Second Amendment. I don t want to do anything to violate the Second Amendment. Jeb Bush is one of the only Republican candidates who does not own a gun and seems to have little personal interest in firearms. But he was avowedly pro-gun during his eight years as governor of Florida and earned an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA). Mr Bush signed the 2005  Stand Your Ground  law, which allows citizens to stand their ground and open fire if they believe are they in danger, even if they have a chance to escape the situation.The next year he signed six gun bills into law, a package he refers to as  the Six Pack of Freedom .Mr Bush has been bullish on gun rights on the campaign trail and said in September that the US government  should not be involved in gun laws  and that regulations should be left to individual states. He has attacked Donald Trump for his past support for Bill Clinton s assault weapons bans.Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas Photo: AP The senator from Texas owns a .357 Magnum revolver and a Beretta Silver Pigeon II hunting shotgun. The Magnum is for self-defence while the shotgun is used for hunting trips, where Mr Cruz mainly shoots birds.His campaign declined to say whether he has a license to carry a concealed weapon.Mr Cruz was solicitor general of Texas before coming to the Senate and was involved in two landmark Supreme Court cases which came down in favour of gun owners.He is a favourite of the NRA as a result and in 2010 the gun lobby group gave him an award in honour of his  exemplary activities in the support and protection of the right to Keep and Bear Arms .Florida Senator Marco Rubio Photo: Javier ManjarresJeb Bush does not own a gun but his fellow Floridian, Marco Rubio, has a Taurus .357 Magnum revolver.The senator said he shoots two to three times a year with his wife, Jeanette, and has a license to carry a concealed gun. He bought the gun in February 2010 just as he was mounting his campaign for the US Senate.Mr Rubio was involved in passing the controversial  Stand Your Ground  laws in Florida while he was in the state House of Representatives but some NRA figures said they thought he could have done more on guns rights and he was given an A ranking in 2010. He talked the talk, but he didn t walk the walk,  Marion Hammer, an NRA lobbyist, told the Tampa Bay Times in 2009.Correction: The NRA initially gave Marco Rubio s rating as a B+. They have since said that was wrong and his rating is an A. We have corrected the story and the graphic to reflect this.Republican presidential candidate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie Photo: AP Photo/Cheryl SenterThe governor of New Jersey is one of just three Republican candidates who does not own a gun and he has often been at odds with the gun lobby.His state has a tradition of strong gun laws and Mr Christie has done little to loosen them during his time in office. While he vetoed a bill that would have limited gun magazines to 10 rounds, he has also said there must be a  balance  between gun rights and public safety. The NRA gave him a C when he ran for re-election in 2013.Mr Christie was excluded from the NRA s annual convention earlier this year and criticised the gun lobby group after it ran a television ad featuring Barack Obama s children.Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson Photo: AP Photo/Ross D. FranklinAn acclaimed neurosurgeon turned populist politician, Ben Carson says he is  extremely pro-second amendment .He owns a gun which he says is for self-defence and for protecting his home and family.While he says he does not shoot frequently, he did recently go trap shooting.Mr Carson was criticised by some gun rights advocates in 2013 when he suggested that semi-automatic weapons should be available in rural areas but not in major cities. It depends on where you live. I think if you live in the midst of a lot of people, and I m afraid that that semi-automatic weapon is going to fall into the hands of a crazy person, I would rather you not have it,  he said at the time.He has since called the second amendment  the baton of freedom  to be passed on to future generations.Rand Paul s campaign confirmed that the Kentucky senator owns multiple guns but, in keeping with his libertarian views on privacy, declined to give details.Mr Paul has an A rating from the NRA but was not invited to their annual convention this year because of his links to the National Association for Gun Rights, a pro-gun group that is even more strident than the NRA.The senator from Kentucky has linked freedom from gun control laws to his broader message of liberty.Republican presidential candidate Gov. John Kasich Photo: AP Photo/Jim ColeThe governor of Ohio has a Sig Sauer 9mm handgun and earned an A- ranking from the NRA during his re-election campaign in 2014.During his time in office he has signed several pro-gun laws and earned praise from activists in his state.But the relationship has not always been so warm. In 1994, when Mr Kasich was a Congressman, he voted for Bill Clinton s ban on assault weapons. The NRA gave him an F ranking in response and endorsed his Democratic opponent in the 2010 race for governor.  Gun owners don t ever forget things like that,  said Jim Irvine, chairman of the Buckeye Firearms Association.  But as governor he s signed everything he could and he s been very good on this issue .Lindsey Graham shooting an AR-15 Photo: FacebookThe South Carolina senator has one of the largest gun collections of any of the candidates. A spokeswoman said he has around a dozen guns including rifles, shotguns and a handgun.Among them is an AR-15 rifle stamped with the insignia of his Air Force unit. He also owns a Sweet-16 Browning, given to him by his father when he was a teenger.Mr Graham s campaign describes him as  an excellent shot  and earlier this year he took donors to a shooting range in Utah. He was given an A- rating by the NRA ahead of his last election in 2014.Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina Photo: AP Photo/Charlie RiedelThe businesswoman has six guns in her home but they belong to her husband, Frank.  My husband is the gun owner in our house,  she told the NRA in April.Mrs Fiorina said she is not a hunter or a target shooter but is a firm supporter of the right to bear arms.  It is our God-given right and it is our Constitutional right,  she said.She was given an A ranking by the NRA when she ran for the Senate in 2010. She lost to incumbent Democrat senator Barbara Boxer, who has been one of the Senate s most outspoken voices on gun control.Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee Photo: Getty Images The former Arkansas governor named his most recent book God, Guns, Grits and Gravy and wrote in it that  in the world that I come from and choose to live in,  gun control  means that you hit the target .He owns  quite a few  guns, and claims to have bought his first, a .22-calibre rifle, when he was only nine years old.He also owns more than one assault rifle. He says in his book that he hunts ducks with a Benelli Super Black Eagle .12 gauge, and deer with a Weatherby .300-magnum rifle.He opposes waiting lists ( anyone who needs a gun for self-defense probably needs it now, not two or three weeks from now ) and was the first American governor to have a concealed-carry license.His platform states that the second amendment is  the last line of defense against tyranny .A spokeswoman for the governor of Louisiana said he owns a gun but declined to give details.However, the staunchly conservative Mr Jindal s Instagram feed shows him and his family posing regularly with weapons.One picture shows him cradling a weapon at a gun store in Iowa. Mr Jindal suspended his campaign briefly in July after a gunman killed two people and himself in a cinema in Lafayette, Louisiana. He called for states to strengthen their gun laws to ensure that people with reported mental illnesses could not purchase guns.Republican presidential candidate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum Photo: AP Photo/Evan VucciThe former senator from Pennsylvania did not respond to the survey but said in 2011 that he owned seven guns.An aide to Mr Santorum told the Daily Caller website that his favourite is a Kimber 1911 pistol.He has a lifetime A+ rating from the NRA after consistently voting against gun control measures.He took a break from campaigning in 2011 to go pheasant hunting in Iowa, and afterward spoke breathlessly about the moment his son John shot his first bird. There s only one thing better than getting a bird, and that s watching your son for the first time getting a bird,  he said.Republican candidate for president and former New York Governor George Pataki Photo: EPA/CJ GUNTHERThe former governor of New York keeps a shotgun at his home for hunting and protection.But that has not saved him from an F rating by the NRA   the worst ranking of any of the 17 Republican candidates.He earned the gun lobby s wrath in 2000 by signing a set of strict gun laws which banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. They were passed in response to a series of high-profile killings in New York, including a massacre on the Long Island Rail Road in 1993, which left six people dead.Via: UK Telegraph</td>\n",

I m sure if you dig deep enough you ll find some sort of Carlos Slim corruption. He s the Mexican billionaire who made tons of money on the  Obamaphone  he provided for America. Nice, huh? We ll be checking into this one just to see if there s any connection to American corruption. It just doesn t pass the smell test MEXICO CITY   Cradling a flat-screen television set in her arms, Tomasa Lopez beamed at her good fortune: She d just taken part in the world s biggest distribution of free digital televisions.Lopez, a domestic servant, was among thousands of people who ve thronged a cavernous tent in the populous working-class Iztapalapa district, one of hundreds of venues across Mexico where the poor are receiving some of the 10 million digital television sets the government is giving away at no charge.It s a program costing the Mexican treasury $1.6 billion in a push to convert the nation from analog television signals to a digital format. The United States made the switch in 2009. I am happy,  Lopez said.  We ve always wanted a digital television. We ll see more channels. The kids will see cartoons. Other nations, such as Argentina, have given away digital television sets, but none on the scale of Mexico, and the program has proved controversial. Critics question why the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto is giving away 24-inch flat-screen televisions, each costing around $145, when decoder boxes that allow older analog televisions to remain in use   the U.S. solution   cost only about $40.It s not just the recipients of TVs who benefit. Television manufacturers clustered along Mexico s northern border also profit, as do the two powerful media conglomerates that are moving quickly into digital services. The two companies will soon face competition from a third television network mandated into existence in 2013 with a constitutional reform to bring greater competition to the industry.At the entrance to the delivery tent, a recipient of a television set, Jose Luis Rodriguez, reproached a government official for suggesting the sets were free. Stop using that word. It s paid for with our taxes. It s not free,  sputtered Rodriguez, who works for the federal social security institute.Already, the government has given away 4.6 million televisions in a massive operation that requires fleets of trucks to deliver the sets, and masses of workers to check documents, take fingerprints and scan the bar codes of the sets to ensure that each family gets only one.Recipients are all low-income Mexicans who take part in one of several government social service programs, including Prospera, which is the national crusade against hunger, and Liconsa, a subsidized milk program.A sense of urgency pervades the program. The constitutional reform enacted in 2013 gives the government a deadline of Dec. 31 to convert the nation to digital television. In recent weeks, government teams have been handing out 30,000 to 40,000 sets a day, but will have to double that figure to meet the deadline.Administrators for the program say it will have many benefits, among them raising the number of people with access to the Internet and cutting electricity usage. An analog television consumes 320 to 340 watts, and if you add a decoder then it s another nine watts,  said Javier Lizarraga Galindo, an adviser behind the program at the Communications and Transport Secretariat.  An energy efficient digital TV like the ones we are giving out in Mexico consumes less than 40 watts. Gabriel Sosa Plata, a professor at the Autonomous Metropolitan University and frequent commentator on television issues, said he thinks energy consumption might actually go up. Although analog signals are supposed to end on Dec. 31, he thinks many people will buy decoder boxes and move the old sets into their children s rooms. Instead of having just one television, they will have two, and that means more electricity consumption,  Sosa Plata said.Skeptics also question whether the TVs really will make the Internet more accessible. The digital TVs offered by the state have USB and HDMI ports, but hooking them to the Internet would require additional hardware and, for now, a contract with a provider, though the government has pledged eventually to offer free wireless service.Mexico already provides free Wi-Fi at or near public parks, squares and government buildings in most of the nation s 2,400 municipalities and under the telecom reform is required to expand it to as many as 250,000 sites by 2018. Still only about 50 percent of Mexico s 120 million citizens regularly access the Internet.Criticism of the program also has centered on the bidding for the purchase of the television sets. Mexico is the world s largest assembler of TVs, producing between 35 and 40 million a year. Seven different companies with plants in Mexico, mostly along the U.S. border, have taken part in supplying the program. The first stage was not as transparent as it should have been. We were all suspicious,  said Jorge Negrete Pacheco, executive director of Mediatelecom, a consultancy in Mexico City on telecommunications regulation.  It was inevitable to think like this because none of the winners (of bids) were known brands. Negrete said the South Korean manufacturer Samsung was disqualified  for offering a better product  than required under the bid conditions. The winner of one bid sold televisions sets under the brand Diamante, largely unknown.The two television networks, Televisa and TV Azteca, are installing digital transmitters around the country. TV Azteca broadcasts on 180 channels while Televisa operates 220 channels. The two companies capture a majority of all advertising spent in the country for all media.By next year, however, a third network will step into the fray. Grupo Imagen Media, owner of Cadenatres, will begin broadcasting, after winning a bid in March to occupy 123 channels spread across the country:HERE S WHAT WE FOUND ON THIS   CARLOS SLIM CONNECTION: Mexican media company Grupo Imagen, which has just won one of two new national TV concessions, may look to move into the lucrative telecoms sector, the chief executive of the family-owned company said on Thursday.Grupo Imagen was awarded the free-to-air TV concession on Wednesday after bidding 1.81 billion pesos ($116.8 million). The auction was part of a government overhaul of the hidebound phone and TV markets, which are controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim s America Movil and broadcaster Televisa.Grupo Imagen, the media arm of privately held banking, hotel, construction and hospital company Grupo Empresarial Angeles (GEA), is run by Olegario Vazquez Aldir, an up-and-coming Mexican mogul.In an interview, Vazquez Aldir acknowledged the threat posed to free-to-air TV by new technologies including Netflix, and said the company might at some point follow in the footsteps of Televisa, by looking to move into the more lucrative telecoms market. I don t rule out that in the future, we could strike alliances with telecoms companies,  he said.  We understand perfectly well the challenges posed by new technologies, and that the younger generations are consuming content through other digital platforms. Vazquez Aldir said he had not spoken with Slim or any other telecom companies. Slim s America Movil is trying to offload assets to comply with new regulation resulting from the government s telecom reform, which was finalized last year.Grupo Imagen expects to invest 10 billion pesos in the new network over the next 36 months, Vazquez Aldir said. It aims to be broadcasting in Mexico s main cities by January 2016 and to have the rest of the country covered within three years.The money would mainly be spent on buying or renting land to install broadcast infrastructure, he said, adding that the company hoped to sell its content eventually in the United States, to capitalize on the growing Latino market thereNegrete said the advent of a third channel  is a democratic message because it will offer a new source of information, different newscasts.

pushing for an end to the death penalty in America. It is something the party has never done before, even though it has fielded candidates opposed to the criminal punishment.Progressives are rightly pointing it out as a considerable move in the right direction.The latest draft of the party s platform, released Friday, says the death penalty  has proven to be a cruel and unusual form of punishment  that  has no place in the United States of America. The inclusion of the provision represents a victory of sorts for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders   a longtime opponent of the punishment who has said he is remaining in the presidential race in order to fight for progressive causes.Sanders offered mild praise for the platform Friday evening, tweeting,  The Democratic Platform includes some accomplishments that will begin to move this country in the right direction. The party platform is not binding, and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton has not completely come out against the penalty. During the primary debates, Clinton said she believed it had  very limited use  in the case of the most extreme crimes, like terrorist attacks similar to 9/11.The inclusion of anti-death penalty language continues the forward momentum seen over the last few years in which several states have banned the practice.The United States is only one of 36 countries in the world that still has capital punishment. It is banned in 103 countries, and in another 50 countries it has not been used for 10 years while still remaining on the books.Executions have been trending downwards in America over the last few years. In 2009, 52 people were executed, dropping to 35 in 2014 and 28 in 2015. So far in 2016, 14 people have been executed in the United States with the most recent being Earl Forrest on May 11, 2016 in Missouri. Forrest killed two people in a drug dispute, then killed a sheriff s deputy in an ensuing shootout.Featured image via Flickr  ...   1.0\n",
              "2  Republican presidential candidates were asked if they owned a gun. Here s how they stacked up:A profile on each the remaining GOP candidates, including their NRA rating can be found here:Donald Trump owns a handgun. Here he is pictured receiving a ceremonial rifle at a military academy Photo: Getty Images Donald Trump appears to be part of a rare breed: a New Yorker with a handgun.New York City has some of the most stringent gun laws in the country and applicants for a gun license go through a lengthy process and must be interviewed in person by police.But a 2010 list of gun owners in the city showed Mr Trump had a carry business license, which allows him to carry a concealed handgun on his person. To get a carry business license you must prove you have a valid reason to carry a gun related to work   for example if you work with cash and might be targeted for robbery. It is unclear what reason Mr Trump gave in order to obtain his license but he could argue his public profile makes him a potential target.The billionaire was cagey during an interview with NBC earlier this year, saying he still had a gun and a license but it was  none of your business  if he ever used it. A spokeswoman declined to give details.Mr Trump has flitted between being a Democrat, Republican and independent in recent years and his positions on gun control have shifted also.In 2000, he wrote that he backed Bill Clinton s ban on assault weapons and supported  a slightly longer  waiting period for buying a gun. He appears to have recanted and no longer supports any new gun controls. The problem is once you get into that you start getting into a situation, the slippery slope, where all of a sudden you are going to really violate the Second Amendment. I don t want to do anything to violate the Second Amendment. Jeb Bush is one of the only Republican candidates who does not own a gun and seems to have little personal interest in firearms. But he was avowedly pro-gun during his eight years as governor of Florida and earned an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA). Mr Bush signed the 2005  Stand Your Ground  law, which allows citizens to stand their ground and open fire if they believe are they in danger, even if they have a chance to escape the situation.The next year he signed six gun bills into law, a package he refers to as  the Six Pack of Freedom .Mr Bush has been bullish on gun rights on the campaign trail and said in September that the US government  should not be involved in gun laws  and that regulations should be left to individual states. He has attacked Donald Trump for his past support for Bill Clinton s assault weapons bans.Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas Photo: AP The senator from Texas owns a .357 Magnum revolver and a Beretta Silver Pigeon II hunting shotgun. The Magnum is for self-defence while the shotgun is used for hunting trips, where Mr Cruz mainly shoots birds.His campaign declined to say whether he has a license to carry a concealed weapon.Mr Cruz was solicitor general of Texas before coming to the Senate and was involved in two landmark Supreme Court cases which came down in favour of gun owners.He is a favourite of the NRA as a result and in 2010 the gun lobby group gave him an award in honour of his  exemplary activities in the support and protection of the right to Keep and Bear Arms .Florida Senator Marco Rubio Photo: Javier ManjarresJeb Bush does not own a gun but his fellow Floridian, Marco Rubio, has a Taurus .357 Magnum revolver.The senator said he shoots two to three times a year with his wife, Jeanette, and has a license to carry a concealed gun. He bought the gun in February 2010 just as he was mounting his campaign for the US Senate.Mr Rubio was involved in passing the controversial  Stand Your Ground  laws in Florida while he was in the state House of Representatives but some NRA figures said they thought he could have done more on guns rights and he was given an A ranking in 2010. He talked the talk, but he didn t walk the walk,  Marion Hammer, an NRA lobbyist, told the Tampa Bay Times in 2009.Correction: The NRA initially gave Marco Rubio s rating as a B+. They have since said that was wrong and his rating is an A. We have corrected the story and the graphic to reflect this.Republican presidential candidate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie Photo: AP Photo/Cheryl SenterThe governor of New Jersey is one of just three Republican candidates who does not own a gun and he has often been at odds with the gun lobby.His state has a tradition of strong gun laws and Mr Christie has done little to loosen them during his time in office. While he vetoed a bill that would have limited gun magazines to 10 rounds, he has also said there must be a  balance  between gun rights and public safety. The NRA gave him a C when he ran for re-election in 2013.Mr Christie was excluded from the NRA s annual convention earlier this year and criticised the gun lobby group after it ran a television ad featuring Barack Obama s children.Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson Photo: AP Photo/Ross D. FranklinAn acclaimed neurosurgeon turned populist politician, Ben Carson says he is  extremely pro-second amendment .He owns a gun which he says is for self-defence and for protecting his home and family.While he says he does not shoot frequently, he did recently go trap shooting.Mr Carson was criticised by some gun rights advocates in 2013 when he suggested that semi-automatic weapons should be available in rural areas but not in major cities. It depends on where you live. I think if you live in the midst of a lot of people, and I m afraid that that semi-automatic weapon is going to fall into the hands of a crazy person, I would rather you not have it,  he said at the time.He has since called the second amendment  the baton of freedom  to be passed on to future generations.Rand Paul s campaign confirmed that the Kentucky senator owns multiple guns but, in keeping with his libertarian views on privacy, declined to give details.Mr Paul has an A rating from the NRA but was not invited to their annual convention this year because of his links to the National Association for Gun Rights, a pro-gun group that is even more strident than the NRA.The senator from Kentucky has linked freedom from gun control laws to his broader message of liberty.Republican presidential candidate Gov. John Kasich Photo: AP Photo/Jim ColeThe governor of Ohio has a Sig Sauer 9mm handgun and earned an A- ranking from the NRA during his re-election campaign in 2014.During his time in office he has signed several pro-gun laws and earned praise from activists in his state.But the relationship has not always been so warm. In 1994, when Mr Kasich was a Congressman, he voted for Bill Clinton s ban on assault weapons. The NRA gave him an F ranking in response and endorsed his Democratic opponent in the 2010 race for governor.  Gun owners don t ever forget things like that,  said Jim Irvine, chairman of the Buckeye Firearms Association.  But as governor he s signed everything he could and he s been very good on this issue .Lindsey Graham shooting an AR-15 Photo: FacebookThe South Carolina senator has one of the largest gun collections of any of the candidates. A spokeswoman said he has around a dozen guns including rifles, shotguns and a handgun.Among them is an AR-15 rifle stamped with the insignia of his Air Force unit. He also owns a Sweet-16 Browning, given to him by his father when he was a teenger.Mr Graham s campaign describes him as  an excellent shot  and earlier this year he took donors to a shooting range in Utah. He was given an A- rating by the NRA ahead of his last election in 2014.Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina Photo: AP Photo/Charlie RiedelThe businesswoman has six guns in her home but they belong to her husband, Frank.  My husband is the gun owner in our house,  she told the NRA in April.Mrs Fiorina said she is not a hunter or a target shooter but is a firm supporter of the right to bear arms.  It is our God-given right and it is our Constitutional right,  she said.She was given an A ranking by the NRA when she ran for the Senate in 2010. She lost to incumbent Democrat senator Barbara Boxer, who has been one of the Senate s most outspoken voices on gun control.Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee Photo: Getty Images The former Arkansas governor named his most recent book God, Guns, Grits and Gravy and wrote in it that  in the world that I come from and choose to live in,  gun control  means that you hit the target .He owns  quite a few  guns, and claims to have bought his first, a .22-calibre rifle, when he was only nine years old.He also owns more than one assault rifle. He says in his book that he hunts ducks with a Benelli Super Black Eagle .12 gauge, and deer with a Weatherby .300-magnum rifle.He opposes waiting lists ( anyone who needs a gun for self-defense probably needs it now, not two or three weeks from now ) and was the first American governor to have a concealed-carry license.His platform states that the second amendment is  the last line of defense against tyranny .A spokeswoman for the governor of Louisiana said he owns a gun but declined to give details.However, the staunchly conservative Mr Jindal s Instagram feed shows him and his family posing regularly with weapons.One picture shows him cradling a weapon at a gun store in Iowa. Mr Jindal suspended his campaign briefly in July after a gunman killed two people and himself in a cinema in Lafayette, Louisiana. He called for states to strengthen their gun laws to ensure that people with reported mental illnesses could not purchase guns.Republican presidential candidate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum Photo: AP Photo/Evan VucciThe former senator from Pennsylvania did not respond to the survey but said in 2011 that he owned seven guns.An aide to Mr Santorum told the Daily Caller website that his favourite is a Kimber 1911 pistol.He has a lifetime A+ rating from the NRA after consistently voting against gun control measures.He took a break from campaigning in 2011 to go pheasant hunting in Iowa, and afterward spoke breathlessly about the moment his son John shot his first bird. There s only one thing better than getting a bird, and that s watching your son for the first time getting a bird,  he said.Republican candidate for president and former New York Governor George Pataki Photo: EPA/CJ GUNTHERThe former governor of New York keeps a shotgun at his home for hunting and protection.But that has not saved him from an F rating by the NRA   the worst ranking of any of the 17 Republican candidates.He earned the gun lobby s wrath in 2000 by signing a set of strict gun laws which banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. They were passed in response to a series of high-profile killings in New York, including a massacre on the Long Island Rail Road in 1993, which left six people dead.Via: UK Telegraph  ...   1.0\n",
